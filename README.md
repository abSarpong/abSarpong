#### Hi! I'm Michael

I am a software engineer with specialization in frontend development. Currently I'm helping build solutions for farmers across Africa at Agrocenta. I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I am a very logical person when it comes to problem solving, my approach includes breaking down large problems into chunks and connecting the dots to form back the bigger picture. There’s no greater joy to me than successfully transforming manual workflow to the digital form with well known problem solving techniques.

With a little over 3 years experience building digital products, I will admit it hasn’t been easy but a learning curve and massive exposure to real world problems. I previously led a team of three on our final year project to build an attendance system which caught the eyes of authorities and are willing to deploy for commercial use by the school on which I was the frontend developer.

Communication is very key in every environment which is why I manage to communicate clearly to my understanding first before putting it across to any team I find myself as a member. Paying critical attention to details is one of my greatest strengths as a person before an engineer. One thing I know I'm not is shying away from learning new things. In fact as a kid I taught myself lots of sports just to keep up with friends.

My escape route from this cold world is playing Fifa which I kind of suck at, listening to music heavily and sometimes watching movies.
