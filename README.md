### Hi! I'm Michael

Michael is a software engineer currently based in Ghana with specialization in frontend development who is passionate about using logical approach in making life simple and meaningful to end users by transforming manual workflow into user friendly digital products.

Previously, I worked at Agrocenta as a user interface developer where I helped build solutions for farmers across Ghana which directly connects the smallholder farmer in the staple food value chain to a wider online market and also access to digital services such as digital payments, micro lending and pensions.
