  "description": "I am a software engineer with specialization in frontend development. Currently I'm helping build solutions for farmers across Africa at Agrocenta. I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I am very logical when it comes to problem solving, my approach includes breaking down large problems into chunks and connecting the dots to form back the bigger picture. Thereâ€™s no greater joy to me than successfully transforming manual workflow to the digital form with well known problem solving techniques.",
